            <h3>Classic Audit Engagement</h3>
            <p>Each engagement includes a classic audit in which we scour your code for all known vulnerabilities.</p>

            <h3>Customized Static Analysis Tools</h3>
            <p>For each engagement, we develop and deploy sound static analysis tools customized to your codebase to offer assurances specific to your code.</p>

	  <h2>Our Static Analysis Approach</h2>

	  <p>
	    Broadly speaking, static analysis tools come in two flavors, depending on the kind of guarantees they can provide.
	    <i>Complete</i> tools are adept at finding bugs and guarantee that any malfeasance they detect is a genuine bug, making them ideal for non-expert end users.
	    However, complete tools are in general unable to demonstrate that particular bugs don't exist—they exhibit false negatives.
	    <i>Sound</i> tools, in contrast, are adept at demonstrating that particular classes of bugs do not exist.
	    Like a typechecker, they rule out misbehavior before the program ever runs—misbehavior specific to your program.
	    However, this strong guarantee comes at a cost: sound tools can raise false positives, which can be difficult to identify as such.
	    This particular feature makes them ideal for use by expert auditors.
