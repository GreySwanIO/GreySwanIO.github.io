            <h1>Our Novel Audit Methodology</h1>
            <p>At Grey Swan, we've pioneered an audit process that integrates the rigor of sound static analysis with the nuanced understanding of seasoned security experts. This allows us to establish and verify properties specific to your smart contracts, approaching the thoroughness of formal verification without the prohibitive costs.</p>

            <h2>Key Pillars of Our Approach:</h2>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>1. Expert-Guided Static Analysis</h3>
                <p>Our process begins with advanced static analysis tools, many developed from our team's academic research. However, tools alone are not enough. Our expert auditors guide this analysis, defining relevant properties and interpreting results to uncover subtle vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.</p>

                <h3>2. Contract-Specific Property Verification</h3>
                <p>Instead of generic checklists, we work to understand the intended behavior of your specific smart contract. We then formulate and verify properties that ensure your contract behaves as designed and is free from critical vulnerabilities. This tailored approach provides a deeper level of assurance.</p>

                <h3>3. Cost-Effective Formal Verification Principles</h3>
                <p>We apply principles from formal verification to bring a higher degree of mathematical certainty to your audit. By focusing on critical properties and leveraging efficient analysis techniques, we deliver this enhanced assurance at a significantly lower cost than traditional formal verification methods.</p>

                <h3>4. Comprehensive Reporting & Remediation Support</h3>
                <p>Our audit reports are clear, concise, and actionable. We detail all findings, explain their potential impact, and provide concrete recommendations for remediation. We also offer post-audit support to ensure vulnerabilities are correctly addressed.</p>
