        <p>Go beyond best practices and manual reviews. We describe the properties of your protocol to give you an audit
          report that lasts into the future.</p>

          Audits are a snapshot. Properties are forever.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Traditional audits offer a point-in-time assessment. They find bugs today, but can't stop new ones from
          creeping in tomorrow. This reactive model leaves protocols perpetually vulnerable.

          Our methodology is fundamentally proactive and persistent. We don't just look for bugs; we work with you to
          specify and document the intended properties of your system, which can then be used to guide future development
          and security.

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="bottom-border">Founded on research and real-world impact.</h3>
        <p>
          We are a boutique shop founded by an academic programming language researcher, a former OpenZeppelin auditor,
          and no outside investors. We want to take the time to secure protocols and deliver insights, not just render reports.
